ITBAN2 Streamlit Workbook

III. Sidebar and Layout Procedure
First is importing the necessary libraries like streamlit and pandas
then create page title and desription
then create a sidebar for filters
then simulate or load a dataset
then add a filter in the sidebar
then use the st.tabs to organize content (one for explaining concepts and the other is for showing filtered data)
then add content in Tab I which is the overview
then Use st.columns to show practices side-by-side
then add content in Tab 2 which is the Filtered data Table
then Add an st.expander for metrics summary and a chart
then add another st.expander for link or resources (this is for further learning)
then after this all i save my VSCode work file named sidebar_and_layout.py
then after saving i run it through anaconda terminal
